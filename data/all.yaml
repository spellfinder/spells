      alarm with the sound and volume of a hand bell (in which case the spell gains the auditory trait).

  type: SPELL
  level: 8
  rarity: 2
  casting: [aM, aS, aV]
  area: 10-foot aura
  duration: concentration, up to 1 minute
  description:
    main:
      Spells can't penetrate the area, magic items cease to function within
      it, and no one inside can cast spells or use magic abilities. Likewise,
      spells—such as dispel magic—can't affect the field itself unless they
      are of a higher level. Magic effects resume the moment they pass
      outside the field. For example, a ray fired from one side of the field
      could target a creature on the other side (as long as caster and
      target are outside). A summoned creature winks out of existence
      but reappears if the field moves or ends. Invested magic items cease
      to function, but they remain invested and function when the item
      exits; the ability boost from a potent item isn't suppressed. Spells of
      a higher level than the antimagic field overcome its effects, and can
      even be cast by a creature within the field.
      The field disrupts only magic, so a +3 longsword still functions as
      a master-quality longsword. Magically created creatures (such as
      golems) function normally within an antimagic field.
arcane-countermeasure:

  range: 120 feet
  target: the spell cast by the triggering creature
  description:
    main:
      You undermine the target spell, making it easier to defend against.
      You reduce the spell's level by 1, and targets gain a +1 conditional
      bonus to any saving throws, skill checks, AC, or DC against it.
      You can't reduce the spell's level below its minimum (if any).
      For example, a 5th-level cone of cold would remain 5th-level, but a
      5th-level fireball would become 4th-level.

  range: touch
  target: one item or work of art
  duration: 24 hours
  description:
    main:
      You infuse the target with artisanal and artistic vision. Its quality
      increases to match your proficiency rank in Crafting, to a maximum
      of expert. The target is a beautiful and impressive piece for its new
      quality, but the effect is obviously temporary, so it can't be sold for
      more than normal. This doesn't allow you to use the target to Craft
      a magic item that requires the new quality or perform any other
      task requiring a permanent item of that quality.
  heightened:
    4th: If you spend 1 additional Spell Point, the maximum quality increases to master.

      The GM rolls a secret DC 6 flat check. On a failure, the result
      is always "nothing." This makes it impossible to tell whether a
      "nothing" result is accurate. If anyone casts augury on the same

      with you or the actions you convinced it to take clash with its

      You draw the target into a lucid dream where it can explore
      the endless possibilities of its own potential within the everchanging

      uninterrupted, when it wakes, it counts as having spent a day

      The target appears to fall down dead, though it actually turns
      invisible. Its illusory corpse remains where it fell, complete with an
      appropriate fatal wound. This illusion looks and feels like a dead
      body. If the target's death seems absurd—for instance, a barbarian
      at full health appears to be slain by 2 damage—the GM can grant the
      attacker an immediate Perception check to disbelieve the illusion.
      If the target acts hostile, the spell is dismissed afterward. This
      ends the entire spell, so the illusory corpse disappears too.

  description:
    main:
      You try to create a temporary duplicate of an enemy. The target
      can attempt a Fortitude save to disrupt the spell. The duplicate
      appears in an unoccupied space adjacent to the target and has the
      target's attack modifier, AC, saving throw modifiers, Perception,
      and skill modifiers, but it has only 70 Hit Points and lacks the
      target's special abilities, including immunities, resistances, and
      weaknesses. It has no magic items except weapon potency runes.
      The duplicate gains the minion trait, and it can only Stride
      and Strike. Its Strikes deal the target's normal damage but don't
      apply added effects, since it doesn't have special abilities.
      The spell automatically ends if its HP drop to 0.
      The duplicate attacks your enemies to the best of its abilities.
      You can attempt to command it as if you used Command a Minion
      as part of your action to Concentrate on the Spell, but the GM
      determines whether the creature follows your command.
      The duplicate is imperfect, so each turn after it takes its
      actions, it loses 8d6 Hit Points. It's not a living creature, and it
      can never regain its lost Hit Points in any way. ${subsection.save}

  description:
    main:
      Choose a single fact you want all targets to believe. Their experiences
      color how they react to this “truth” and how their behavior changes.
      If the fact changes what they perceive, they treat the change as a
      sudden revelation. The fact could be narrow, such as “a dragon is
      circling overhead and wants to kill me”; wide-reaching, such as “all
      humanoids are disguised abominations”; or conceptual, such as “if I
      don't live a kinder life, I'll be punished in the afterlife.”
      The effect depends on the targets' Will saves. If a target is
      already subject to fabricated truth, your spell tries to dispel it. If
      the check fails, the target can't get an outcome worse than success.

  description:
    main:
      "You gain a sixth sense that warns you of danger that might
      befall the target of the spell. If you choose a creature other than
      yourself as the target, you create a psychic link through which
      you can inform the target of danger. This link is a mental effect.
      While foresight is in effect, the target gains a +2 conditional
      bonus to initiative rolls and can't be flat-footed. In addition, you
      gain the following reaction.
      Foresight Trigger: The target of foresight defends against a
      hostile creature or other danger. Effect: The target rolls two dice and
      uses the higher result if it's being forced to roll (like with a saving
      throw), or the attacker or danger must roll twice and use the lower
      result (like with an attack or skill check). This is a fortune effect if the
      target is rolling twice, or a misfortune effect if the hostile force is.
      Due to the amount of information this spell requires you to
      process, you can't have more than one foresight spell in effect at
      a time. Casting foresight again dismisses the previous foresight."

      only for the purpose of determining whether you see through it (for
      instance, if the check succeeds against an illusory disguise spell, you
      see the creature's true form but it doesn't end the illusory disguise).

  description:
    main:
      Creatures in the area are outlined by glittering dust, with an effect
      depending on their Reflex save results. If a creature has its invisibility
      negated by this spell, it is concealed instead of invisible. This applies
      both if the creature was already invisible and if it benefits from new
      invisibility effects before the invisibility negation effect runs out.

  casting: [aS, aV]
  area: 10-foot burst centered on one corner of your space
  duration: 1 minute
  description:
    main:
      You create an immobile globe around you that attempts to dispel
      any spell from outside the globe whose area or targets enter into
      the globe, as if the globe were a dispel magic spell 1 level lower
      than its actual spell level. Even if the dispel attempt succeeds, it
      prevents only the portion of the spell that would have entered the
      globe (so if the spell also had targets outside the globe or part of
      its area were beyond the globe, those targets or area would still
      be affected normally). You must form the sphere in an unbroken
      open space so its edges don't pass through any creatures or
      objects or the spell is lost (though creatures can enter the area
      afterward normally).

  description:
    main:
      Your mouth transforms into a shadowy maw bristling with pointed
      teeth. These jaws grant you an unarmed attack you're trained in,
      dealing 1d6 piercing damage. They have the finesse trait.
      Attacks with your jaws have the following enhancement.
      Enhancement If the target was living, gain 1d4 temporary HP.
  heightened:

      Your jaws gain the effects of a +1 weapon
      potency rune (a +1 item bonus to attack rolls and an additional

glyph-of-warding:
  name: GLYPH OF WARDING
  type: SPELL
  level: 3
  rarity: 0
  traits: [abjuration]
  casting-time: 10 minutes
  casting: [M, S, V]
  range: touch
  target: one container or 10-foot-by-10-foot area
  duration: unlimited until dismissed
  description:
    main:
      While Casting this Spell, you also Cast a Spell of a lower spell level
      to stored in the glyph. The stored spell must take 3 actions or
      fewer to cast, have a hostile effect, and target one creature or have
      an area. You can set the glyph with a password, a trigger stimulus,
      or both. Any creature that opens the target container or enters the
      target area without speaking the password or matching the trigger
      stimulus activates the glyph, releasing the harmful spell within.
      Once a spell is stored in the glyph, the glyph gains all the traits
      of that spell. If the spell targets one or more creatures, it targets the
      creature that set off the glyph. If the spell has an area, that area is
      centered on the creature that set off the glyph. Glyph of warding's
      duration ends when the glyph is triggered. The glyph counts as a
      magical trap, using your spell DC for both the Perception check to
      notice it and the Thievery check to disable it; both checks require
      the creature attempting them to be trained in order to succeed.
      You can dismiss glyph of warding with a Verbal Casting action.
      The maximum number of glyphs of warding you can have active at
      a time is equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.

            succeed at a Reflex save or an Acrobatics check to Maintain
            Balance against your spell DC or fall prone. Creatures
            moving onto the greasy surface after the spell is cast must
            also attempt an Acrobatics check to Balance. A creature
            that takes a Step doesn't have to attempt a check or save.
          "Target an Object":
            If you cast the spell on an unattended
            object, those trying to pick up the object must succeed at an
            Acrobatics check against your spell DC to do so. If you target an
            attended object, the creature that has the object must attempt
            an Acrobatics check. On a failure, the holder or wielder takes
            a –2 circumstance penalty to any attack roll or to any check
            attempted that involves using the object; on a critical failure,
            the holder or wielder drops the item. The object lands in an
            adjacent square of the GM's choice. If the object is worn, the

            throws against attempts to grapple or shove them.

      bonus to one attack roll, Perception check, saving throw, or skill
      check the target attempts before the duration ends. The target

  duration: 1 hour
  description:
    main:
      The target consistently believes one thing is another, can't detect
      something that's there, or detects something that's not there. You
      choose which of these options applies and determine the specifics
      of the hallucination. For example, you could make the target think
      all elves are humans, be unable to detect the presence of his
      brother, think his beloved pocket watch is always on his person
      even when it isn't, or believe there's a tower in the center of town.
      The target can attempt a Will save to disbelieve the hallucination
      every time he Seeks or Interacts with the subject of the hallucination.
      For example, the target could attempt to disbelieve each time he
      encountered an elf, bumped into his brother accidentally, tried to
      check his pocket watch, or studied the tower to spot vulnerabilities.
      The target can attempt to disbelieve with a large circumstance
      bonus in circumstances determined by the GM, such as if the target
      attempted to climb the nonexistent tower.

      You mime creating an invisible 10-foot-by-10-foot
      stretch of wall adjacent to you and within your reach. The wall
      is solid to those creatures who don't disbelieve it, and you and
      your allies can choose to believe the wall exists in order to keep
      it solid, for instance in order to climb onto it. Even incorporeal
      creatures who fail to disbelieve the wall can't pass through it.
      A creature who disbelieves is bolstered against your house of
      imaginary walls. The wall doesn't block objects or creatures who
      didn't see your visual performance. The wall has AC 10, TAC 6,
      and Hardness equal to twice the spell's level.
humanoid-form:
  name: HUMANOID FORM
  type: SPELL
  level: 2
  rarity: 0
  traits: [polymorph, transmutation]
  casting: [aS, aV]
  duration: 10 minutes or until dismissed
  description:
    main:
      You transform your appearance to look like a Small or Medium
      humanoid, such as a drow, dwarf, elf, goblin, halfling, human, orc,
      or lizardfolk. You count as a humanoid in addition to your normal
      traits while in this form, as well as gaining any trait related to the
      creature's kind (such as goblin or human). If this transformation
      reduces your size, it reduces your reach accordingly (using the
      effects of the shrink spell). This transformation doesn't change
      your statistics in any way. You can still wear and use your gear,
      and it changes size to match your new form if necessary. The
      item's size change ends immediately if the item leaves your person.
      You don't gain the special abilities of the humanoid form you
      assume. This spell grants you a +4 conditional bonus to Deception
      checks to pass as a generic member of the chosen ancestry, but
      you can't make yourself to look like a specific person. If you want
      to Impersonate an individual, you still need to create a disguise,
      though the GM won't factor in the difference in ancestry when
      choosing the DC of your Deception check.
  heightened:
    3rd: You gain darkvision or low-light vision if the form you assume has that ability.
    5th:
      You can take on the appearance of a Large humanoid. If this increases your size,
      you gain the effects of the enlarge spell.

  description:
    main:
      You create a pattern of shifting colors that hovers in the air.
      Creatures are dazzled while inside the pattern. A creature must
      attempt a Will saving throw if it is inside the pattern when you cast
      it, when it enters the pattern, ends its turn within the pattern, or
      uses a Seek or Interact action on the pattern. A creature currently
      fascinated by the pattern doesn't need to attempt new saves.

illusory-creature:
  name: ILLUSORY CREATURE
  type: SPELL
  level: 2
  rarity: 0
  traits: [auditory, illusory, visual]
  casting: [aS, aV]
  range: 500 feet
  duration: concentration
  description:
    main:
      You create an illusory image of a Huge or smaller creature. It
      makes appropriate sounds, generates normal smells, and feels
      right to the touch. If you and the image are ever farther than 500
      feet apart, the spell ends.
      The image can't speak, but you can use your actions to speak
      through the creature, with the spell disguising your voice as
      appropriate. You might need to attempt a Deception or Performance
      check to convincingly mimic the creature, as determined by the
      GM. This is especially likely if you're trying to imitate a specific
      person and engage with someone that person knows.
      In combat, the illusion counts as a creature for flanking. It uses
      your spell roll for attack rolls and saving throws and your spell
      DC for its AC. If the image is hit by an attack or fails a save, the
      spell is dismissed. The creature has two actions per turn, which it
      takes when you Concentrate on the Spell.
      The illusion can't directly affect the physical world, though
      its attacks can cause damage by making the target believe
      they're real. If the illusory creature hits with a Strike, the
      target takes mental damage equal to 1d4 plus your spellcasting
      ability modifier. This is a mental effect. The illusion's Strikes are
      nonlethal. If the damage doesn't correspond to the image of the
      monster—for example, if a Large dragon dealt only 5 damage—
      the GM might allow the target to attempt a Perception check
      to disbelieve the spell as a free action. Any relevant resistances
      and weaknesses apply if the target thinks they do, as judged
      by the GM. For example, if the illusion wields a warhammer and
      attacks a creature resistant to bludgeoning damage, the creature
      would take less mental damage. However, illusory damage does
      not suppress regeneration or trigger other effects that require a
      certain damage type.
      Any creature that touches the image or uses the Seek
      action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion.
      When a creature disbelieves the illusion, it recovers from half
      the damage it had taken from it (if any) and doesn't take any
      further damage from it. The GM should track illusory damage
      dealt by the illusion.
  heightened:
    "+1":
      The damage of the image's Strikes increases by
      1d4 and the maximum size of creature you can create increases
      by one (to a maximum of Gargantuan).
illusory-disguise:
  name: ILLUSORY DISGUISE
  type: SPELL
  level: 1
  rarity: 0
  casting: [aS, aV]
  traits: [illusion, visual]
  duration: 1 hour or until dismissed
  description:
    main:
      Your illusion can make you appear as another creature of the
      same body shape and roughly similar height (within 6 inches) and
      weight (within 50 pounds). The disguise is typically good enough
      to hide your identity, but not to impersonate a specific individual.
      The spell doesn't change your voice, scent, or mannerisms. You
      can also make clothing and items you wear appear different, such
      as making your armor look like an ordinary dress. Held items are
      unaffected, and any worn item you remove returns to its true
      appearance until you don it again.
      Casting illusory disguise counts as setting up a disguise for
      the Impersonate use of Deception it ignores any circumstance
      penalties you might take for disguising yourself as a dissimilar
      creature, and it gives you a +4 conditional bonus to your
      Deception checks to avoid others seeing through your disguise.
      You can dismiss this disguise with a Verbal Casting action.
  heightened:
    2nd: The spell also disguises your voice and scent, and it gains the auditory trait.
    3rd:
      You can appear as any creature of the same
      size, even a specific individual. You must have seen an individual
      to take on their appearance. The spell also disguises your voice
      and scent, and it gains the auditory trait.
illusory-object:
  name: ILLUSORY OBJECT
  type: SPELL
  level: 1
  rarity: 0
  traits: [illusion, visual]
  casting: [aS, aV]
  range: 500 feet
  area: 20-foot burst
  duration: 10 minutes
  description:
    main:
      You create an illusory visual image of a stationary object. The
      entire image must fit within the spell's area. The object appears
      to animate naturally, but it doesn't make sounds or generate
      smells. For example, water would appear to pour down an
      illusory waterfall, but it would be silent.
      Any creature that touches the image or uses the Seek action
      to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion.
  heightened:
    2nd:
      Your image makes appropriate sounds,
      generates normal smells, and feels right to the touch. The spell
      gains the auditory trait. The duration increases to 1 hour.
    5th: As the 2nd-level version, but the duration is unlimited.
illusory-scene:
  name: ILLUSORY SCENE
  type: SPELL
  level: 5
  rarity: 0
  traits: [auditory, illusion, visual]
  casting-time: 10 minutes
  casting: [V, S]
  range: 500 feet
  area: 30-foot burst
  duration: 1 hour
  description:
    main:
      You form an imaginary scene that includes up to 10 discrete
      creatures or objects of various sizes, all of which must be
      within the spell's area. These elements all generate appropriate
      sounds and smells, and they feel right to the touch. Elements
      of an illusory scene are incapable of speech. Unlike the illusory
      creature spell, creatures in your scene lack combat abilities and
      statistics. Your scene doesn't include changes to the environment
      around it, though you can place your scene within the illusory
      environment of a hallucinatory terrain spell.
      When you create the scene, you can choose to have it be
      static or follow a program. Though a static scene is stationary,
      it includes basic natural movement. Wind blowing on an illusory
      piece of paper would rustle it, for example. A program can be
      up to 1 minute long, and it repeats when finished. For instance,
      you could create a programmed scene of two orcs fighting each
      other, and their fight would go the same way for each repetition.
      If you create a loop, the two fighters end up in the same place
      at the start of the fight and at the end of it, but you can smooth
      the program so it's hard to tell when the loop ends or begins.
      However, anyone observing long term almost always notices the
      program looping. You're unable to alter the program after you
      create the illusion.
      Any creature that touches any part of the image or uses the
      Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion.
      If they were interacting with a portion of the illusion, they
      disbelieve only that portion. They disbelieve the entire scene
      only on a critical success.
  heightened:
    6th:
      Creatures or objects in your scene can speak.
      You must speak the specific lines for each actor when creating
      your program. The spell disguises your voice for each actor
      as appropriate.
    8th: Per 6th-level, and the duration is unlimited.

      be subject to the same effect. You can't affect more than one

      The GM might rule that you can't use this ability if the act of

      The target becomes invisible. This makes it unseen to all

      While exploring, it's easy to move together and remain

      picked a type of objects, such as “swords”). If the target is a specific
      object, you must have observed it directly with your own senses.
      If it's general, you still need to have an accurate mental image of
      the type of object. If there's lead or running water between you
      and the target, you can't locate the object. If you picked a type of
      object, this means you might find that is an object farther away if

      combination that once opened a lock affected by this spell does
      not do so for the duration of the spell.
      If the lock is opened, the spell is dismissed. Assuming the target
      is not barred in some other way, you can unlock and open it by
      spending a Somatic Casting action during which you touch the
      target. Doing so does not dismiss the spell. You can dismiss the spell
      at any time and from any distance with a Verbal Casting action.

      you can cast. If the target is magical, you can instead choose to
      have it not register as magical at all.
      A caster using detect magic or study aura of an equal or higher
      spell level can attempt to disbelieve the illusion of a magic aura.
      Magic aura doesn't mask auras of spells that are 9th level or

  range: 30 feet
  duration: 24 hours
  description:
    main:
      You conjure an extradimensional demiplane consisting of a
      spacious dwelling with a single entrance. The entrance connects
      back to the plane where you cast the spell, appearing where you
      choose within the spell's range. It appears as a faint, shimmering,
      vertical rectangle 5 feet wide and 10 feet high. You designate who
      can enter when you cast the spell. Once you enter the portal, you
      can shut the entrance, making it invisible. You and creatures you
      designated can reopen the door at will with the Interact action, just
      like opening a physical door. Other creatures must use extraplanar
      travel, such as plane shift, in order to enter the mansion.
      Inside, the demiplane appears to be a mansion with a
      magnificent foyer and numerous opulent chambers. The mansion
      can have any floor plan you imagine as you cast the spell,
      provided it fits within a space 40 feet wide, 40 feet deep, and 30
      feet tall. While the entrance is closed, effects from outside the
      mansion fail to penetrate it, and vice versa. You can use scrying
      magic and similar effects to observe the outside only if they're
      capable of crossing planes.
      A staff of up to 24 servants attends to anyone within the
      mansion. These are like the servant created by the unseen
      servant spell, though they're visible, with an appearance you
      determine during casting. The mansion is stocked with enough
      food to serve a nine-course banquet to 150 people.

  target: one creature
  duration: 1 minute
  description:
    main:
      The target appears to be a gruesome and terrifying creature to anyone observing it. The effect is
      unique to each observer, so a human viewing the target might
      see a demon with bloody fangs and a demon observing the target
      might see a glowing angelic visage.
      When any creature attempts a hostile action or reaction against
      the target, the creature must attempt a Will save. Once it does, it
      doesn't need to attempt another save against mask of terror for
      any actions or reactions it spends until the end of its next turn.
      ${subsection.save}

      target can spend 1 action to attempt a Survival check or Perception
      check against your spell DC to escape the maze.
      The possible outcomes of the Survival check or Perception check are as follows.
      ${subsection.outcomes}
      Teleportation magic doesn't help the creature escape unless
      the magic can transport across planes, such as plane shift. When
      the spell ends, either because the target escaped or the duration
      ran out, the target returns in the space it occupied when it was
      banished, or the nearest space if the original space is now filled.
      It loses any remaining actions it would have on its current turn,
      but it can spend reactions normally.

      You form a direct connection with your divine source and request

  duration: 1 minute or until dismissed
  description:
    main:
      Three illusory images swirl about your space, potentially causing
      those who attack you to hit one of the images instead of you. Any
      attack that would hit you has a random chance of hitting one of
      your images instead. If you have all three images up, there is a 1 in
      4 chance of hitting you (1 on a 1d4). With two images up, there is a
      1 in 3 chance of hitting you (1–2 on a 1d6). With only one image the
      chances are 1 in 2 (1–3 on a 1d6). If an image is hit, it is destroyed.
      If the attack roll is a critical success and would hit one of the
      images, it becomes a success against you and one of the images
      is also destroyed. Once all the images are destroyed, the spell
      is dismissed.

  duration: 1 day or until dismissed
  description:
    main:
      You designate one target as the primary target and the other
      as the secondary target. All effects that would detect auras on
      the primary target instead detect the same types of auras from
      the secondary target. A creature reading the aura can attempt
      to disbelieve the illusion. You can dismiss the spell with a Verbal
      Casting action from up to a mile away.
mislead:
  name: MISLEAD
  type: SPELL
  level: 6
  rarity: 0
  traits: [illusion]
  casting: [aS, aV]
  duration: concentration, up to 1 minute
  description:
    main:
      You turn yourself invisible and create an illusory duplicate of
      yourself. When you Concentrate on the Spell, you can mentally
      dictate a course of action for your duplicate to follow that round.
      Your duplicate acts as though it had your full number of actions,
      though it can't actually affect anything in the environment.
      Both the invisibility and the duplicate remain as long as you
      concentrate. Per a 4th-level invisibility spell, committing a
      hostile action doesn't end mislead's invisibility. A creature that
      determines the duplicate is an illusion doesn't necessarily know
      you're invisible, and one that can see your invisible form doesn't
      necessarily know your duplicate is an illusion.
      If you Cast a Spell, attack, or otherwise interact with another
      creature, you can attempt a Deception check as part of that
      action against observers' Perception DCs to convince them
      your duplicate took that action. This doesn't fool anyone who's
      aware your duplicate is an illusion, nor does it work if the attack
      obviously couldn't have come from the duplicate. For instance,
      if you fired a ray you could make it look like it came from the
      duplicate, if the duplicate is positioned appropriately, but if you
      attack with a staff and your duplicate is across the room from the
      target, your attempt at deception would fail.

      You alter the target's memories, either erasing a memory,
      enhancing a memory's clarity, altering a memory, or adding a false
      memory. The target can attempt a Will save to resist the spell.

            The target is unaffected but thinks your spell was
            something harmless instead of modify memory, unless
            it identifies the spell (usually by spending the Identify
            Magic action).
          crit:
            The target is unaffected and realizes you tried
            to alter its memory.
          failure:
            During the first 5 minutes of the spell's duration, you
            can Concentrate on the Spell to modify a memory once
            each round. When you do, you imagine up to 6 seconds of
            memory to modify, to a maximum of 5 continuous minutes
            of memory.
            Any memories you've altered remain changed as long as the spell
            is active. If the target moves out of range before the 5 minutes is
            up, you can't alter any further memories.
  heightened:
    6th:
      You can cast the spell on a willing target in
      order to suppress all memory of a particular topic, detailed in 50
      words or fewer. The spell patches these omissions with indistinct
      haze. Instead of having a duration, the effects last indefinitely
      even in the absence of magic and can be removed only by
      powerful spells such as alter reality.

      The target experiences a day's worth of recovery in an instant. Any
      detrimental effects that would be gone after 24 hours end, though
      this doesn't shorten the duration of any active spells affecting the
      target. The target regains Hit Points and recovers from conditions
      as if it had taken 24 hours of rest. The creature doesn't regain
      spells for resting or get other benefits of rest other than healing.

      as much for most Tiny creatures, and so on), and most Large
      creatures eat 10 times as much as a human (100 times as much

      Animals, plants and weather in the area turn against the targets.
      Each target suffers from the following effects. ${subsection.effects}
      The GM might determine that you can't subject some
      creatures to the ire of nature. For example, a primal spellcaster
      of your level or higher or an avatar of nature might be immune

            entangled any time they're adjacent to a plant or a surface
            of stone or earth.
          - Aggressive animals attack unpredictably then depart. At
            the start of its turn, each target rolls a DC 8 flat check. On
            a failure, it's attacked by swarming creatures that deal 2d10
            slashing damage. The target can attempt a Reflex save, taking
            half damage on a success, no damage on a critical success, or
            double damage on a critical failure. The target is flat-footed
            for 1 round on any result other than a critical success.
          - The target also loses any connection to nature or natural
            creatures. Any animal or plant creature becomes hostile to
            it, even a companion creature like an animal companion.

      The target loses its scent, preventing creatures from noticing it
      using scent alone. A creature attempting a Perception check with
      scent and other senses might be able to notice the lack of natural

      or attempts to dispel all detection, revelation, and scrying
      divinations made against the target or the target's gear

            whenever attempting a Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation,
            or Performance check, and all creatures she encounters have

      You surround yourself with a supernatural

      This causes the targets to pay tribute to you by bowing or
      spending some other action in keeping with your appearance.
      The number of times they must do this depends on the outcome
      of their Will saves.
      ${subsection.save}
      Paying tribute is a manipulate action or move action, as
      chosen by the creature paying tribute. A creature under this
      effect must pay tribute to you at least once on each of its turns
      if possible. While under this spell, a creature is fascinated by
      you and can't act in a hostile fashion toward you. The target is

            The target believes everyone it sees is a potential
            threat. It becomes unfriendly to all creatures that were
            previously allies, treating only itself as an ally. The spell
            ends after 1 round.
          crit: The target is unaffected.

          crit-fail:
            Per failure, except the target believes that
            everyone it sees is a mortal enemy. It uses its reactions
            and free actions against these enemies regardless of
            whether they were previously its allies, as determined by
            the GM. It otherwise acts as rationally as normal and will
            likely prefer to attack enemies that are actively attacking
            or hindering it.

    main:
      You reduce the tracks you leave behind, adding a +4 conditional
      bonus to the DC needed to track you, or setting the DC of
      tracking you equal to the spell's DC, whichever is higher. You can
      gain only one of these two benefits; casting pass without trace
      multiple times doesn't improve the DC further.
  heightened:
    2nd: The duration increases to 8 hours.
    4th:

  duration: 1 hour

    main:
      You create a visible tunnel through the wall in the chosen area,
      replacing the area with empty space; if the wall is thicker than
      10 feet, the tunnel ends 10 feet in. Even a small layer of metal in
      the wall prevents this spell from functioning. This spell doesn't
      reduce the integrity of the structure, so the wall doesn't collapse
      even if it's load-bearing. When the spell ends, anyone inside the
      tunnel is shunted to the nearest exit.
  heightened:
    7th:
      The tunnel can be up to 20 feet deep.
      The areas of the wall that contain your tunnel's entrance
      (and exit, if applicable) appear completely normal (unless
      subjected to true seeing), despite the tunnel's existence. The
      tunnel's entrance normally counts as a solid wall, but you can
      specify a password or a trigger stimulus. Anyone speaking
      the password or fulfilling the trigger stimulus can enter the
      tunnel freely.

  target: one willing creature, or up to eight willing creatures joining hands
  description:
    main:
      The target or targets move to another dimensional plane,
      such as the Plane of Fire, the Shadow Plane, Hell, or the
      Abyss. Attempting to reach a particular plane requires specific
      knowledge of the plane and a magic tuning fork created from
      material from that plane; while the tuning forks for most
      prominent planes are uncommon, just like the spell plane
      shift, more obscure planes and demiplanes often have rare
      tuning forks.
      The spell is highly imprecise, and you appear 1d20×25 miles
      from the last place one of the targets (of your choice) was located
      the last time that target traveled to the plane. If it's the first time
      traveling to a particular plane for all targets, you appear at a
      random location on the plane, though you can use other means of
      transit, such as teleport, to travel while on the new plane. Plane
      shift doesn't provide a means of return travel, though casting
      plane shift again allows you to return to your previous plane
      unless there are extenuating circumstances.

  description:
    main:
      You create an opaque wall of shimmering, multicolored light. The
      wall is straight and vertical, stretching 60 feet across and 30 feet
      high. You must form the wall in an unbroken open space so its
      edges don't pass through any creatures or objects or the spell is
      lost. You can pass through the wall and ignore its effects. The wall
      sheds bright light out to 20 feet on each side. Creatures other than
      you that come into the wall's light must succeed at a Will save or
      be blinded for 1 minute. A creature that attempts a save is then
      bolstered against that particular prismatic wall's blinding effect.
      A prismatic wall has seven different colors, each with the effect
      of a 5th-level chromatic wall spell of that color. A creature that
      tries to pass through the wall must attempt a saving throw against
      each component wall. The effects take place simultaneously, so
      a creature turned to stone by the blue wall is still treated as a
      creature for the indigo and violet walls.
      The wall as a whole is immune to dispelling effects of the wall's
      level or lower, but each color must be dispelled by its specific spell,
      as described in chromatic wall. This must be done in order (red,
      orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, then violet). A given color can't
      be affected until the previous color is dispelled. Dispelling a color
      wall removes that color's effect from the wall, and dispelling them
      all ends prismatic wall.

      the area to outside the area. Scrying spells can't perceive any
      stimuli from the area, and mind-reading effects don't work in
      the area.

  description:
    main:
      You project an illusory image of yourself. You must stay within
      range of the image, and if at any point you can't see the image,
      the spell ends. Whenever you Cast a Spell other than an aura
      spell, you can cause the spell effect to originate from either
      yourself or the image. Because the image is an illusion, it can't
      truly benefit from spells, though any visual manifestations of the
      spell appear. The image has AC equal to your TAC and the same
      saves as you. If it is hit by an attack or fails a save, the spell ends.

      The target gains a +1 conditional bonus to their Armor Class

      You create an invisible, floating eye, 1 inch in diameter, at a location
      you can see within 500 feet. It sees in all directions with your normal
      visual senses and continuously transmits what it sees to you.
      The first time you Concentrate on the Spell each round, you can
      either move the eye up to 30 feet, seeing only things in front of
      the eye or move it up to 10 feet, seeing everything in all directions
      around it. There is no limit to how far from you the eye can move, but
      if you and the eye ever cease to be on the same plane of existence,

      Violent winds and a powerful downdraft fill the area, forming a

      area is greater difficult terrain for flying and difficult terrain for
      creatures on the ground or climbing. Any creature that ends its
      turn flying within the area descends 20 feet. Any creature pushed
      into a surface by this spell's winds takes falling damage.
      The squares at the outside vertical edges of the cylinder prevent
      creatures from leaving. They're greater difficult terrain, and any
      creature attempting to push through must succeed at an Athletics
      check (or Flying Maneuver) against your spell DC to get through. A

  description:
    main:
      You attempt to call forth the dead creature's soul, requiring the
      creature's body be present and relatively intact. The creature
      must have died within the past 3 days. If Pharasma has decided
      that the creature's time has come (GM's discretion), or if the
      creature doesn't wish to return to life, this spell automatically
      fails, but the diamonds aren't consumed in the casting.
      If the spell is successful, the creature is no longer dead
      and returns to life with 1 Hit Point, no spells prepared, no
      points in any pools, and it is still suffering from any longterm
      debilitations of the old body. The time spent in the
      Boneyard leaves the character temporarily debilitated, making
      it enervated 2 for 1 week; this condition can't be removed or
      reduced by any means until the week has passed. The creature
      is also permanently changed in some way by their time in the
      afterlife, such as a slight personality shift, a streak of white in
      the hair, or a strange new birthmark.

  range: 30 feet
  target: one object
  description:
    main:
      You focus on the target object. When the casting is
      complete, you know whether or not that item is magical and, if it
      is, you learn the school of magic (see page 194).
      If the object is illusory, you detect this only if the effect has a
      lower level than the level of your read aura spell.

read-fate:

  rarity: 1
  traits: [divination, prediction]
  casting-time: 10 minutes
  casting: [M, S, V]
  range: 10 feet
  target: one creature other than you
  description:
    main:
      You attempt to learn more about the target's fate in the short
      term, usually within the next day for a creature living a fairly
      sedentary life, or the next hour or less for someone likely to have
      multiple rapid experiences of note, such as someone actively
      adventuring. You learn a single enigmatic word connected
      to the creature's fate that day. Fate is notoriously fickle and
      inscrutable, and the word isn't necessarily meant to be taken at
      face value, so the meaning is often clear only in hindsight. The
      GM rolls a secret DC 6 flat check (see page 292). If the creature's
      fate is too uncertain, or on a failed flat check, the spell results
      in the word “inconclusive.” Either way, the creature is bolstered
      against read fate.

  duration: 1 minute
  description:
    main:
      The target temporarily gains regeneration 15, which restores
      15 Hit Points to it at the start of each of its turns. While it has
      regeneration, the target can't die from damage and its dying
      value can't exceed 3. If the target takes acid or fire damage, its
      regeneration deactivates until after the end of its next turn.
      Each time the creature regains Hit Points from regeneration,
      it also regrows one damaged or ruined organ (if any). During
      the spell's duration, the creature can also reattach severed
      body parts by spending an Interact action to hold the body part
      to the stump.
  heightened:
    9th: The regeneration increases to 20.

      You attempt to remove one curse afflicting the target. Treat this
      as counteracting the curse (see page 319). If the curse comes
      from a cursed item or other external source, a success indicates
      that the target creature can rid itself of the cursed item, but
      doesn't remove the curse from the item.

  rarity: 0
  traits: [enchantment]
  casting: [aS, aV]
  range: touch
  target: one creature
  description:
    main:
      You can counteract a single fear effect that the target suffers
      from. This can also remove nonmagical fear effects if the source's
      level is equal to or lower than double remove fear's level.
      This frees only the target, not any other creatures under the
      fear effect.

  description:
    main:
      From you extends an aura that prevents creatures from
      approaching you. When casting the spell, you can make the field
      any radius you choose, up to 40 feet. Creatures must attempt
      a Will save if they're in the aura when you cast the spell or as
      soon as they enter the aura while it's in effect. Once a creature
      has attempted the save, it uses the same result for that casting
      of repulsion. Any restrictions on a creature's movement apply
      only if it moves voluntarily toward you. For example, if you move
      closer to a creature, it doesn't then need to move away.

      to either trap or protect it, blocking anything that would cross
      through the sphere. The sphere has AC 5, TAC 5, and Hardness
      10. It can take 2 extra Dents and is destroyed when broken.
      Disintegrate destroys the sphere instantly. The spell's duration
      ends when the sphere is destroyed. If the target is unwilling, the
      effects of the sphere depend on the target's Reflex save.

resplendent-mansion:
  name: RESPLENDENT MANSION
  type: SPELL
  level: 9
  rarity: 0
  traits: [conjuration]
  casting-time: 1 minute
  casting: [M, S, V]
  range: 500 feet
  duration: 24 hours (see text)
  description:
    main:
      You conjure a towering mansion up to four stories tall and up to
      300 feet on a side. While casting the spell, you hold an image of
      the mansion and its desired appearance in your mind. The mansion
      can contain as many or as few rooms as you desire, and it is
      decorated as you imagine it. You can imagine a purpose for each
      room of the mansion, and the proper accouterments appear within.
      Any furniture or other mundane fixtures function normally for
      anyone inside the mansion, but they cease to exist if taken beyond
      its walls. No fixture created with this spell can create magical
      effects, but magical devices brought into the mansion function
      normally.
      Your mansion contains the same types of foodstuffs and
      servants as created by the magnificent mansion spell.
      Each of the mansion's exterior doorways and windows are
      protected by alarm spells. You choose whether each alarm is
      audible or mental as you cast the spell, and each has a different
      sound (for an audible alarm) or sensation (for a mental one),
      allowing you to instantly determine which portal has been used.
      When you prepare spells, you can choose not to recover the
      spell slot or daily spell you used to cast this spell. If you do, the
      mansion remains for another 24 hours.
      The mansion must be created on a plot of land free of other
      structures. It adapts to the natural terrain, adopting the structural
      requirements for being built there. The mansion adjusts around small
      features such as ponds or spires of rock, but can't be created on
      water or other nonsolid surfaces. If created on snow, sand dunes, or
      other soft surfaces with a solid surface underneath, the foundation
      reaches the solid ground. If created on a solid but unstable surface,
      such as a swamp or an area plagued by tremors, there's a 10% chance
      each day the mansion begins to sink or collapse.
      The mansion doesn't harm creatures within the area when it
      appears, and it can't be created within a crowd or in a densely
      populated area. Any creature inadvertently caught inside the
      mansion when the spell is cast ends up unharmed inside the
      complete mansion and always has a clear path of escape.

      When you cast restoration, choose to either reduce a condition or

      than once to reduce the stage of the same exposure to a given toxin.

          "Reduce a Condition":
            Reduce the value of the target's
            enfeebled, sluggish, or stupefied condition by 2. You can
            instead reduce two of the listed conditions by 1 each.
          "Lessen a Toxin":
            Reduce the stage of one toxin the target
            suffers from by one stage. This can't reduce the stage below
            stage 1 or cure the affliction.
  heightened:
    4th:
      Add drained to the list of conditions you can
      reduce. When you lessen a toxin, reduce the stage by two. You
      also gain a third option that allows you to reduce the target's
      enervated value by 1. You can't use this to reduce a permanent
      enervated condition.
    6th:
      Per the 4th-level restoration, but you can
      reduce a permanent enervated condition if you add a Material
      Casting action while casting the spell, during which you provide
      100 gp worth of diamond dust as a cost.
restore-senses:
  name: RESTORE SENSES
  type: SPELL
  level: 2
  rarity: 0
  traits: [healing, necromancy]
  casting: [aS, aV]
  range: touch
  target: one creature
  description:
    main:
      You can counteract a single effect making the target blinded
      or deafened. This can counteract both temporary magic and
      permanent consequences of magic, but it doesn't cure someone
      who is missing the sense from some natural state or effect, such
      as from birth or from a nonmagical wound or toxin.
  heightened:
    6th:
      The spell's range increases to 30 feet, and
      you can target up to 10 creatures. You can choose the effect to
      counteract separately for each selected creature.
retributive-pain:
  name: RETRIBUTIVE PAIN
  type: POWER
  level: 2
  rarity: 1
  traits: [abjuration, mental, nonlethal]
  casting: [rS]
  trigger: A creature in retributive pain's range deals damage to you.
  range: 30 feet
  target: one creature
  description:
    main:
      You vengefully reflect a portion of your pain upon your tormentor.
      The mental damage you deal is equal to half the damage the
      target dealt to you with the triggering effect, to a maximum of 10
      mental damage. This damage decreases or increases depending
      on the target's Fortitude save. ${subsection.save}

    "+1": The maximum mental damage increases by 5.
retrocognition:
  name: RETROCOGNITION
  type: SPELL
  level: 7
  rarity: 0
  traits: [divination]
  casting-time: 1 minute
  casting: [M, S, V]
  duration: concentration, up to 10 minutes
  description:
    main:
      This spell allows you to gain impressions from past events
      that occurred in your current location. Retrocognition reveals
      impressions from events that occurred over the course of the
      last day throughout the first minute of the duration, followed
      by impressions from the next day back the next minute you
      concentrate, and so on. If you witness a traumatic or turbulent
      event through an impression, you lose concentration on the spell
      unless you succeed at a Will save with a DC of 30–35, depending
      on the severity of the event. The GM determines whether an event
      is traumatic and chooses the DC.
  heightened:
    8th:
      You gain impressions of events that occurred
      over the previous year for each minute you concentrate, instead
      of the previous day, though the details diminish, making it harder
      to distinguish impressions from all but the most major events.
    9th:
      You gain impressions of events that occurred
      over the previous century for each minute you concentrate,
      instead of the previous day, though the details diminish, making
      it almost impossible to distinguish impressions from all but the
      most major events.
reverse-gravity:
  name: REVERSE GRAVITY
  type: SPELL
  level: 7
  rarity: 1
  traits: [evocation]
  casting: [aM, aS, aV]
  range: 120 feet
  area: 20-foot radius, 40-foot-tall cylinder
  duration: 1 minute
  description:
    main:
      You reverse gravity in the area. Creatures and objects that aren't
      secured to the ground immediately fall upward to the top of
      the area. A creature might be able to Grab an Edge to arrest its fall
      if it falls past an appropriate edge. If a creature falls against a solid
      object (such as a ceiling), it takes the appropriate amount of falling
      damage and lands on the surface. Once an object or creature
      reaches the top of the area, it floats, caught between the normal
      and reversed gravity. The creature can move along the plane
      where the two forms of gravity meet. Creatures that can levitate or
      fly can use those abilities to mitigate the effects of reverse gravity.
      When reverse gravity ends, all creatures and objects caught in
      the area fall back down. Likewise, anything that moves beyond
      the bounds of the spell's area is subjected to normal gravity again.
revival:
  name: REVIVAL
  type: SPELL
  level: 9
  rarity: 1
  traits: [healing, necromancy]
  casting: [aS, aV]
  range: 30 feet
  target: dead creatures and living creatures of your choice in range
  duration: concentration, up to 10 rounds
  description:
    main:
      All living targets regain Hit Points equal to 9d8 plus your
      spellcasting ability modifier. In addition, you return any number
      of dead targets to life temporarily, with the same effects as raise
      dead and the same limitations. The resurrected creatures have a
      number of temporary Hit Points equal to the amount of healing
      you gave living creatures (instead of having full HP). The revived
      creatures can't regain Hit Points, and once revival's duration
      ends, they lose all temporary Hit Points and die. Revival can't
      resurrect creatures killed by disintegrate or a death effect. It has
      no effect on undead.
ridiculous-notion:

  traits: [emotion, enchantment, mental]
  casting: [aV]
  area: 30-foot aura
  duration: 1 round
  description:
    main:
      You speak a phrase so absurd that it can cause creatures to
      laugh. Each target must attempt a Will saving throw. A target
      is bolstered against your ridiculous notion once it succeeds at its
      save or once the duration ends if it fails the save. ${subsection.save}

      "You focus all your divine energy into transforming yourself into a
      battle form, similar to your normal form but armed with powerful
      divine armaments granted by your deity. Your gear is absorbed
      into your form; the constant abilities of your gear still function,
      but you can't activate any items. When you transform, you gain
      the following. ${subsection.stats}
      The special statistics of your battle form can be adjusted only
      by penalties, circumstance bonuses, and conditional bonuses.
      Your battle form prevents you from casting spells or using most
      actions with the manipulate trait that require your hands (the
      GM determines which manipulate actions you can spend if
      there's doubt). You can dismiss this spell by using an action (this
      action has the concentrate trait)."

            one of the following properties that matches your deity's
            alignment: anarchic, axiomatic, holy, unholy. If your deity
            is true neutral, you instead gain access to the weapon's
            critical specialization effect."
          - 10 temporary Hit Points that go away when you leave your

rope-trick:
  name: ROPE TRICK
  type: SPELL
  level: 4
  rarity: 1
  traits: [conjuration, extradimensional, space]
  casting-time: 10 minutes
  casting: [M, S, V]
  range: touch
  target: one touched piece of rope from 5 to 30 feet long
  duration: 8 hours
  description:
    main:
      You cause the target rope to rise vertically into the air. Where it
      ends, an extradimensional space springs up, connected to the top
      of the rope. This space can be reached only by climbing the rope.
      The entrance to the space can't be seen, and it can be
      pinpointed only by the presence of the rope. The rope can't
      be removed or hidden, though it can be detached from the
      extradimensional space by pulling it with 16,000 pounds of
      weight, critically succeeding at an Athletics check against the
      spell's DC, or destroying the rope. The space holds up to eight
      Medium creatures and their gear. A Large creature counts as
      two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as four Medium
      creatures, and a Gargantuan creature fills the space on its own.
      If the rope is detached or destroyed or if a creature attempts
      to enter the space that would put it over its capacity, the space
      begins to unravel. It disappears in 1d4 rounds, depositing the
      creatures within safely on the ground below.
safeguard-secret:

  target: you and any willing allies
  description:
    main:
      Choose one piece of information that at least some of the targets
      know; affected allies must remain within range for the full minute
      during which you cast the spell. This grants those who know the
      piece of knowledge you have chosen a +4 conditional bonus to skill
      checks (typically Deception checks) to conceal this knowledge and
      to saving throws against spells that specifically attempt to obtain
      this knowledge from them or against effects that would force them
      to reveal it. These bonuses last until you use this power again.

  duration: 24 hours
  description:
    main:
      You sanctify the area, sprinkling it with holy water and preparing
      it to make a stand against your foes. Choose aberrations,

  description:

      You revel in your target's pain. If you succeed at a
      touch attack, your target takes 1d6 mental damage
      (double damage on a critical hit) and becomes sick with pain
      depending on its Will save. As long as the target is sick, you gain a +1

  description:
    main:
      A field of vibrant, ever-changing colors manifests in the air.
      Creatures are dazzled while inside the pattern. A creature must
      attempt a Will saving throw if it is inside the pattern when you
      cast it, enters the pattern, ends its turn within the pattern, or
      uses a Seek or Interact action on the pattern. A creature currently

scrying:
  name: SCRYING
  type: SPELL
  level: 6
  rarity: 1
  traits: [divination, scrying]
  casting-time: 10 minutes
  casting: [M, S, V]
  range: planetary
  target: one creature
  duration: concentration, up to 10 minutes
  description:
    main:
      Scrying works like clairvoyance, except that the image you
      receive is less precise (insufficient for teleport and similar spells)
      and instead of creating an eye in a set location within 500 feet,
      you instead create an eye that appears just above the target.
      You can choose a target either by name or by touching one of its
      possessions or a fallen piece of its body. If you haven't met the
      target in person, scrying's DC is 2 lower, and if you are unaware
      of the target's identity (perhaps because you found an unknown
      creature's fang at a crime scene), the DC is instead 10 lower.
      The effect of scrying depends on the target's Will save.
      ${subsection.save}
    subsections:
      save:
        type: dl

            The spell fails and the target is bolstered
            against scrying for 1 week. The target also gains a glimpse
            of you and learns its rough distance and direction from you.
          failure: The spell succeeds.
          crit-fail:
            The spell succeeds, and the eye follows the

  target: one creature
  description:
    main:
      You shoot a blazing-hot ray of light tinged with
      holy energy. Make a ranged touch attack against
      the target. If you hit, you deal 5d6 fire damage. If
      the target is a fiend or undead, you deal 5d6 additional good
      damage to it. On a critical hit, double all the damage.
      If the light passes through an area of magical darkness or
      targets a creature affected by magical darkness, searing light
      attempts to dispel the darkness. If you need to determine
      whether the light passes through an area of darkness, draw a
      line between you and the spell's target.

      You change the target's text to different text entirely. If the text is
      a spellbook or a scroll, you can change it to show a spell you know
      of secret page's level or lower, though the replacement spell cannot
      be cast or used to prepare a spell. You can also transform the text
      into some other text you have written or have access to. You can
      specify a password that allows any creature touching the book to
      change the text back and forth. You must choose the replacement
      text and the password, if any, when you cast the spell.

      You shape the mutable and quasi-real substance of the Shadow
      Plane into a deadly blast. Choose acid, bludgeoning, cold,
      electricity, fire, piercing, or slashing, and choose a 30-foot cone,
      a 15-foot burst within 120 feet, or a 50-foot line. The blast deals
      7d8 damage of the type you chose to creatures in the area; these

  casting: [rV]
  trigger: a spell or magical effect deals damage
  range: 60 feet
  target: the triggering spell
  description:
    main:
      You transform the triggering spell into a partially illusory version
      of itself. Treat this as a dispel attempt, except that if the dispel
      attempt is successful, any creatures that would be damaged by
      the spell instead take only half as much damage. Treat shadow
      siphon's counteract level as 2 higher for this dispel attempt.
shadow-walk:
  name: SHADOW WALK
  type: SPELL

  rarity: 1
  traits: [conjuration, shadow, teleportation]
  casting-time: 1 minute
  casting: [M, S, V]
  range: touch
  target: you and up to nine willing creatures touched
  duration: 8 hours or until dismissed
  description:
    main:
      The targets enter the edge of the Shadow Plane, where it borders
      the Material Plane. Targets can't see the Material Plane while on
      the Shadow Plane, and while on the Shadow Plane, they are
      exposed to potential encounters with that plane's denizens. The
      shadows on the border between the planes bend space, speeding
      up your movement with respect to the Material Plane. Every 3
      minutes the targets travel along this border, they move as far as
      they would through the Material Plane in 1 hour. At any point,
      a target can dismiss the spell's effects, although this affects
      only that target. The shadow bending is inexact, so when the
      spell ends, the targets appear roughly 1 mile from their intended
      location on the Material Plane (though those who are traveling
      together appear together).

      You transform yourself into any form you could choose with a

  duration: until your next turn or until dismissed
  description:
    main:
      You raise a magical shield of force to protect you.
      This counts as using the Raise a Shield action (see the sidebar) to
      gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next
      turn, though it doesn't require a hand to use.
      While the spell is in effect, you can also use the Shield Block
      reaction with your magic shield. The shield has Hardness 4. After
      you use Shield Block, the spell is dismissed and you can't cast it
      again for 10 minutes. Unlike a normal Shield Block, you can use
      the spell's reaction against the magic missile spell.
      Heightening the spell increases the Hardness.

  target: one nonmagical object up to 20 cubic feet in volume and up to 80 Bulk
  duration: 1 day or until dismissed
  description:
    main:
      You shrink the target to roughly the size of a coin. This reduces
      it to negligible Bulk. You can dismiss the spell with a Verbal
      Casting action or by tossing the object onto a solid surface.
      The object can't be used to attack or cause damage when it
      returns to normal size. If there isn't room for the object to
      return to normal size when the spell ends, the spell's duration

      You harmlessly place your unique magical sigil, which is about
      1 square inch in size, on the touched creature or object. The
      mark can be visible or invisible, and you can change it from
      one state to another by spending a Somatic Casting action
      during which you touch the target.
      The mark can be scrubbed or scraped off with 5 minutes of
      work. If it's on a creature, it fades naturally over the course of
      a week. The time before the mark fades increases depending

  rarity: 0
  traits: [illusion]
  casting: [aS, aV]
  range: touch
  target: one willing creature
  duration: 1 minute
  description:
    main:
      The target makes no sound, preventing creatures from
      noticing it using hearing. The target can't use sonic attacks,
      nor can it use actions with the auditory trait. (This prevents it
      from casting spells that include Verbal Casting actions.)
  heightened:
    4th:
      The silence effect emanates from the
      touched creature, silencing all sound in or passing through a
      10-foot radius and preventing any auditory and sonic effects
      in the affected area. While within the radius, creatures are
      subject to the effects listed above. Depending upon the
      position of the effect, a creature might be able to notice the
      lack of sound reaching it. For example, if the silence effect
      blocks a corridor leading to a noisy party, a creature might
      notice those sounds abruptly cease.

  description:
    main:
      You can ask questions of, receive answers from, and use the
      Diplomacy skill with animals. The spell doesn't make them more
      friendly than normal. Wary and cunning animals are likely to be

      spell doesn't make them more friendly or intelligent than normal.
      Most normal plants have a limited and distinctive view of the world
      around them, so they don't recognize details about creatures or
      know anything about the world beyond their immediate vicinity.

  description:
    main:
      You create a semicorporeal hand out of your essence that
      delivers touch spells for you. Whenever you Cast a Spell with a
      range of touch, you can have the hand crawl to a target within
      range along the ground, touch it, and then crawl back to you.
      When making a melee touch attack with the hand, you use your
      normal bonuses. The hand can move as far as it needs to within
      range, and its movement doesn't trigger reactions. The hand has
      your AC and saves, but any damage to the hand destroys it and

  description:
    main:
      Choose a spell and name it aloud as part of the Verbal Casting
      action. Spell immunity attempts to dispel that spell (see page
      197) whenever spell immunity's target is the target of the named
      spell or in that spell's area. Successfully dispelling a spell that

      the effects only for spell immunity's target.
spell-turning:
  name: SPELL TURNING
  type: SPELL
  level: 7
  rarity: 1
  traits: [abjuration]
  casting: [aS, aV]
  duration: 1 hour
  description:
    main:
      This abjuration reflects spells cast at you back at their caster.
      When a spell targets you, you can spend a reaction to have spell
      turning attempt to reflect it. This works like dispelling the spell,
      but if the spell is successfully dispelled, the effect is turned back
      on the caster. Whether or not the dispel attempt is successful,
      spell turning ends. Spell turning can't affect spells that aren't
      targeted (such as area spells).
      If spell turning reflects a spell back at a caster who also is
      under the effect of spell turning, his spell turning can attempt to
      reflect his own spell back at you again; if he does so, his dispel
      attempt automatically succeeds.

          failure:
            Whenever the target becomes affected by a spell with

            and each time she takes persistent force damage from
            spellwrack she reduces the remaining duration of spells
            affecting her by 1 round. An Arcana check at spellwrack's
            DC is required to lower the DC of the flat check for the

      A Medium guardian made of pure magical force manifests
      and attacks foes you designate within range. This guardian is
      ghostly and translucent and appears to be holding your deity's
      favored weapon.
      When you cast the spell, the spiritual guardian appears in
      an unoccupied space next to a foe of your choice within range
      and makes a Strike against it. Each time you Concentrate on
      the Spell, you can move the spiritual guardian to an unoccupied
      space next to a new target within range (if you choose to do so
      and make a Strike with it. The guardian uses and contributes
      to your multiple attack penalty. Alternatively, when you
      Concentrate on the Spell, you can have the guardian move
      adjacent to an ally and protect that ally. If you do, each time
      the ally would take damage, the guardian takes the first 10
      damage instead of your ally. It continues to do so until you
      move the guardian to attack an enemy or defend a different
      ally or until the guardian is destroyed (it has 30 Hit Points and
      can't recover Hit Points by any means). The guardian can't take
      damage except when protecting an ally, though disintegrate
      automatically destroys it if it hits the spiritual guardian's TAC
      of 25.
      Attacks with the guardian use your attack modifier with
      that type of weapon but use your spellcasting ability modifier
      instead of the normal ability modifier. Regardless of the
      weapon's appearance, the guardian deals force damage equal
      to 1d10 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. When you
      Strike with the guardian, you can choose to deal damage of
      the normal damage type of the weapon it holds instead of force
      damage (or any of the available damage types for a versatile
      weapon). No other attributes of the weapon apply, and even
      a ranged weapon attacks adjacent creatures only. A spiritual
      guardian's weapon counts as a weapon for triggers, resistances,
      and so forth.
      The guardian takes up space and grants flanking (even with
      a ranged weapon), but it doesn't have any other attributes a
      creature would normally have, aside from Hit Points, and
      creatures can move through its space without hindrance. The
      guardian can't make any kind of attack other than a normal
      Strike, and feats or spells that affect weapons or enhance allies
      do not apply to the guardian's attacks.

    "+2": The guardian's damage increases by 1d10 and its Hit Points increases by 10.

  description:
    main:
      A weapon made of pure magical force manifests and attacks foes
      you designate within range. This weapon is ghostly and appears
      as your deity's favored weapon.
      When you cast the spell, the weapon appears next to a foe
      of your choice within range and makes a Strike against it. Each
      time you Concentrate on the Spell, you can move the weapon to
      a new target within range (if you choose to do so) and make a
      Strike with it. The spiritual weapon uses and contributes to your
      multiple attack penalty.
      Attacks with the weapon use your attack modifier with
      that type of weapon, but substitute your spellcasting ability
      modifier instead of the normal ability modifier. Regardless of its
      appearance, the weapon deals force damage equal to 1d8 plus
      your spellcasting ability modifier. When you Strike with the
      weapon, you can deal damage of the normal damage type of the
      weapon instead of force damage (or any of the available damage
      types for a versatile weapon). No other attributes of the weapon
      apply, and even a ranged weapon attacks adjacent creatures only.
      A spiritual weapon counts as a weapon for triggers, resistances,

      You can ask questions of and receive answers from natural or

      natural spirits of the stone, which have a personality colored by
      the type of stone, as well as by the type of structure the stone is
      part of, for worked stone. A stone's perspective, perception, and
      knowledge give it a worldview different enough from a human's
      that it doesn't consider the same details important. Stones can

            The storm deals 4d10 bludgeoning damage to creatures
            beneath it. A successful Fortitude save reduces the damage
            to half (no damage on a critical success).
          Lightning:

            Each creature in the storm must succeed at
            a Fortitude save or be deafened for 10 minutes. A creature
            that succeeds is bolstered against thunderclaps from the

      creature, you can grant the creature either a +2 conditional bonus or
      a –2 conditional penalty to its saving throw against the toxin.
talking-corpse:

  rarity: 1
  traits: [necromancy]
  casting-time: 10 minutes
  casting: [M, S, V]
  range: touch
  target: one corpse
  duration: 10 minutes
  description:
    main:
      You grant the corpse a semblance of life, which it uses to speak
      the answers to three questions. This uses the physical body's
      latent memories rather than calling back the deceased's spirit,
      so the corpse must be mostly intact. The more damage it has
      taken, the more inaccurate or patchwork its answers, and it
      must have a throat and mouth to speak at all. If anyone has
      previously cast this spell on the corpse in the last week, the spell
      automatically fails. The corpse can attempt a Will save to resist
      the questions as if it were the original creature at its time of
      death, with the following effects.

            any rest for 1 day.
          failure:
            The target must answer truthfully, but its answers can
            be brief, cryptic, and repetitive. It can still mislead you or
            attempt to stall so that the spell's duration runs out before
            you can ask all your questions.
          crit-fail:
            Per failure, but the target's answers are more

      creepers. This vine has a 15-foot reach and makes a melee touch
      attack using your bonus. If the attack succeeds, the vine pulls
      the target into the creepers and makes it immobile for 1 round
      or until the creature Escapes (using your spell DC as the Escape

      object (bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing). Make a ranged attack
      against the target. If you hit, you deal 1d10 damage of the given
      type; you deal double damage on a critical hit. No special traits or
      magic properties of the hurled item affect the attack or damage.
      You can heighten the spell to hurl more objects, though you
      attempt only one attack roll and target only one creature, and
      your salvo of projectiles deals damage all at once for the purposes
      of resistances, weaknesses, and the like. Only one damage type

  casting: [M, S, V]
  range: 100 miles
  target: you and up to four willing creatures touched
  description:
    main:
      You and the targets instantly transport to any location within
      range, as long as you can identify the location precisely both
      by its position relative to your starting position and by its
      appearance. Incorrect knowledge of the location's appearance
      usually causes the spell to fail, but it could lead to teleporting to
      an unwanted location or some other unusual mishap determined
      by the GM.
      Teleport is not precise over great distances. The targets
      appear at a distance from the intended destination equal
      to roughly 1% of the total distance traveled, in a direction
      determined by the GM. For short journeys, this lack of precision
      is irrelevant, but journeys of the maximum 100 miles are 1 mile
      off target.
  heightened:
    7th: You and the targets can travel to any location within 1,000 miles.
    8th:
      You and the targets can travel to any location

      You and the targets can travel to any location
      on another planet within the same solar system. Assuming
      you have accurate knowledge of the location's position and
      appearance, you arrive on the new planet 100 miles off target.

      failure, and the critical failure can't be reduced by abilities
      that usually reduce critical failure, such as improved evasion.
      If the triggering ability did not have both a critical success and

  description:
    main:
      You temporarily stop time for everything but you, allowing
      you to use an incredible number of actions in a short period

      of actions, 1 round passes, but only for you, effects specifically
      targeting or affecting you, and effects you create during the
      stoppage. All other creatures and objects are invulnerable to
      your attacks, and you can't target or affect them with anything.
      Once you have finished your actions, time begins to flow again
      for the rest of the world. If you had created an effect whose
      duration extends past the end of the spell, such as a wall of fire,
      it immediately affects others again as normal, though it doesn't
      have any of the effects that normally happen when you first

  description:
    main:
      You can ignore magical impediments to your movement as if you
      benefited from the freedom of movement spell. This doesn't let

  range: 100 feet
  area: 20-foot burst
  target: one creature or object and up to five willing creatures
  duration: 1 hour
  description:
    main:
      This spell grants perfect sight based on scrying, allowing subjects
      to track the exact movements or position of one creature or object.
      Choose one target creature or object in the area to be tracked. It
      becomes the sensor for the spell. Up to five willing creatures of
      your choice in the area can see a ghostly image of this creature or
      object when it's out of their sight. They can perceive the creature
      or object perfectly, allowing them to ignore invisibility or the
      concealed condition, though physical barriers still provide cover.
      The tracking creatures can see the tracked creature or object
      through all barriers other than lead or running water, which block
      their vision. Distance also doesn't matter, though the creature or
      object might move so far away it becomes too small to perceive.
      You don't scry any of the environment around the creature or
      object, though you do see any gear a creature is wearing or
      holding and can tell if it removes objects from its person.
      If you try to track an unwilling creature, the effect depends
      on its Will save. ${subsection.save}

  description:
    main:
      You summon an unseen servant (see the sidebar), which you
      can command as part of Concentrating on the Spell. It serves
      you until the duration expires

        content:
          - You gain resistance 10 to precision damage and resistance
            10 to extra damage from critical hits. If the resistance
            is greater than the extra damage, it reduces the extra
            damage to 0 but doesn't reduce the attack's normal
            damage. Any creature attacking you should calculate the
            normal damage and extra damage separately while your
            anatomy is altered.
          - You gain darkvision.
          - Acid oozes from your skin. Any creature that hits you with
            an unarmed attack or with a non-reach weapon takes 2d6
            acid damage.

      negative damage to living creatures in the area, based on their
      Fortitude saves. ${subsection.save}

  range: touch
  target: one living creature
  description:
    main:
      You deal 4d6 negative damage to the target
      (double damage on a critical hit). You gain
      temporary Hit Points equal to the negative damage the target
      takes (after applying resistances and the like). You lose any

veil:

  rarity: 0
  traits: [illusion, visual]
  casting: [aS, aV]
  range: 30 feet
  target: up to 10 creatures
  duration: 1 hour or until dismissed
  description:
    main:
      You disguise the targets as other creatures of the same body
      shape and roughly similar height (within 6 inches) and weight
      (within 50 pounds). The disguise can hide the targets' identities
      or let them appear to be of another ancestry, but it's not good
      enough to impersonate specific individuals. The spell doesn't
      change voice, scent, or mannerisms. You choose the disguise for
      each target, so you could make one appear to be a dwarf and
      another an elf, for example.
      Casting veil counts as setting up a disguise for the purpose of
      the Impersonate action. It ignores any circumstance penalties
      the targets might take for being disguised as a dissimilar
      creature, and it also gives the targets a +4 conditional bonus to
      Deception checks to prevent others from seeing through their
      disguises. You can dismiss any or all of these disguises with a
      Verbal Casting action.
  heightened:
    5th: The spell also disguises the targets' voices and scents, gaining the auditory trait.
    7th:
      The targets can appear as any creature of the
      same size, even specific individuals. You must have seen an
      individual to reproduce their appearance. The spell also disguises
      the targets' voices and scents, gaining the auditory trait.

  description:
    main:
      You surround yourself in a veil of confidence, causing fear
      to slide off you as long as the veil lasts. Reduce your current
      frightened condition by 1, and whenever you would become
      frightened during the duration, reduce the amount by 1. If you
      critically fail a saving throw against a fear effect during the
      duration, veil of confidence ends immediately and you increase
      the frightened condition you gain from the critical failure by 1
      instead of decreasing it.

      sound can attempt to disbelieve your illusion.
  heightened:
    2nd:
      The spell's duration increases to 1 hour,
      and you can also change the tone, quality, and other aspects

  description:
    main:
      You create a pattern of lights in the air that pulses with intense
      light. Creatures are dazzled while inside the pattern. A creature
      must attempt a Will saving throw if it's inside the pattern when
      you cast it, enters the pattern, ends its turn within the pattern, or
      uses a Seek or Interact action on the pattern. A creature currently
      blinded by the pattern doesn't need to attempt new saving throws.

            at the end of each of its turns, to a maximum duration of
            1 minute.

      of a door).
      If you have a pool of Spell Points, when the spell's duration

      animated saw blades. Any creature that's inside the burst when
      it's created, enters the burst, or ends its turn inside the burst
      must attempt a Will save to avoid taking 11d8 mental damage. A
      creature that tries to Interact with the monsters or observes one

  description:
    main:
      The ground opens up, spraying a column of lava high into the
      air in a vertical cylinder, dealing 17d6 fire damage. Creatures in
      the area must attempt a Reflex save or take 17d6 fire damage.
      The lava rapidly cools, and creatures in the area might become
      partially encased in rock depending on their Reflex saves. A
      creature encased in rock is sluggish 1, is hampered 5 feet,
      and when flying treats all normal terrain as difficult terrain. A
      flying creature immediately descends 20 feet the moment it's
      encased, but doesn't take falling damage from this movement.
      A creature encased in rock can attempt to Break Open or
      Escape against your spell DC to end the effect. Otherwise, the
      creature remains encased until it takes a total of 50 damage,
      freeing it from the rock. ${subsection.save}
      Additionally, creatures in the area that critically succeed at
      their saves and creature that are within 5 feet of the lava column

      of flame in a straight line or a 5-foot-thick, 10-foot-radius ring of
      flame. The wall stands vertically in either form
      if you wish, the
      wall can be of a shorter length or height. Everything on each
      side of the wall is concealed from creatures on the opposite

  description:
    main:
      You form an invisible wall of pure magical force up to 50 feet
      across and up to 20 feet high. The wall has no discernible
      thickness. If the wall's surface would be broken by any creature
      or object, the spell is lost. The wall has AC 10, TAC 6, and Hardness
      23, and it can take 3 additional Dents before being broken. If the
      wall is broken, the spell ends. The wall blocks physical effects
      from passing through it, and because it's made of force, it blocks
      incorporeal and ethereal creatures as well. Teleportation effects
      can pass through the barrier, as can visual effects (since the wall
      is invisible).
      Wall of force is immune to dispelling effects of its level or
      lower, but the wall is automatically destroyed by a disintegrate
      spell of any level or by contact with a sphere of annihilation or
      rod of cancellation.

      it must be anchored on both sides to a solid surface) or a 1-footthick,
      10-foot hemisphere of ice. The ice that makes up the
      wall is opaque. If you wish, the wall can be of a smaller length,
      height, or radius. You must evoke the wall in an unbroken open
      space so its edges don't pass through any creatures or objects,
      or the spell is lost.
      Each 10-foot-by-10-foot section of the wall has AC 10, TAC
      8, and Hardness 13. Each section is immune to cold and water.
      A section also has weakness to fire 15
      a section of the wall
      broken by fire is completely destroyed immediately, melting
      and evaporating into water and steam. A section broken or
      destroyed by means other than fire can be moved through as
      difficult terrain and deals 2d6 cold damage to anyone passing
      through it.

      stone. You can shape the wall's path, placing each 5 feet of the
      wall on the border between squares. The wall doesn't need to
      stand vertically, so you can use it to form a bridge or set of stairs,
      for example. You must conjure the wall in an unbroken open
      space so its edges don't pass through any creatures or objects or
      the spell is lost. Each 5-foot-by-5-foot section of the wall has AC
      10, TAC 6, and Hardness 17. A broken section of the wall can be
      moved through, but rubble created from it is difficult terrain.

      the following effects.
      Physical ranged attacks, such as arrows, bolts, sling bullets,

      passes through the wall. Massive ranged weapons and spell
      effects that don't create physical objects pass through the wall
      without trouble.
      Creatures attempting to move overland through the wall treat
      it as difficult terrain. Gases, including creatures in gaseous form,
      can't pass through the wall.
      A creature that spends a move action to attempt to fly through

      reduction from difficult terrain by half for the duration, as long

  description:
    main:
      You create an illusion that makes a surface appear hazardous.
      Any surface in that area (typically the ground) is filled with
      illusory hazards. Any creature moving through the illusion
      treats the squares as difficult terrain. A creature can attempt
      a Seek action to disbelieve the effect (see page 194). If it
      succeeds, it ignores the effect for the remaining duration.
      Casting warped terrain again ends any previous warped terrain
      you created.

      You can make the warped terrain appear

      outside the regular patrols and activities, and the spell ends.
      If the city guard isn't currently engaged in such an activity, the

weapon-of-judgment:
  name: WEAPON OF JUDGMENT
  type: SPELL
  level: 9
  rarity: 0
  traits: [evocation, force]
  casting: [aS, aV]
  requirements: You have a deity.
  range: 100 feet
  target: one creature
  duration: 1 minute
  description:
    main:
      An immense weapon of force appears, hovering in the air above
      the target. The weapon has the ghostly visual appearance of
      your deity's favored weapon. Name war or peace when you cast
      this spell.
      If you name war, the weapon Strikes the target at the end of
      each of its turns that the target failed to act in a hostile manner
      against a particular creature. You mentally choose one creature
      when you name war, and the target instinctively knows which
      creature it is. This must be a creature both you and the target
      can see.
      If you name peace, the weapon Strikes the target each time
      the target acts in a hostile manner against you or one of your
      allies. You mentally choose up to five allies when you name
      peace, and the target instinctively knows who those allies are.
      The weapon Strikes only once per act, even if the act targets
      multiple allies.
      Attacks with the weapon use your attack modifier with that
      type of weapon, but they substitute your spellcasting ability
      modifier instead of the normal ability score. Regardless of its
      appearance, the weapon deals force damage equal to 3d10 plus
      your spellcasting ability modifier. The weapon takes a multiple
      attack penalty, but has its own rather than using yours.
      When you Strike with the weapon, you can deal damage of
      the normal damage type of the weapon instead of force damage
      (or any of the available damage types for a versatile weapon). No
      other attributes of the weapon apply, and even a ranged weapon
      attacks adjacent creatures only. A weapon of judgment counts as
      a weapon for the purposes of triggers, resistances, and so forth.
      The weapon doesn't take up space, grant flanking, or have any
      other attributes a creature would. The weapon can't make any
      kind of attack other than a normal Strike, and feats or spells that
      affect weapons do not apply to this weapon.
  heightened:
    10th: The force damage increases by 1d10.

      The weapon magically multiplies into duplicates that swipe at all
      creatures in either a cone or an aura, dealing five dice of damage
      to creatures in the area. This damage has the same type as the
      chosen weapon and uses the same die size. Determine the die
      size as if you were attacking with the weapon; for instance, if
      you were wielding a two-hand weapon in both hands, you'd use
      its two-hand damage die. Each creature in the area must attempt

      damage or 1 fire damage. A square has AC 5 and TAC 5, and it
      automatically fails its saving throws.
      Each time a creature begins to use a move action while in the
      web, it must attempt an Athletics check or Reflex save against your
